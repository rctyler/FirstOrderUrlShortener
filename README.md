# FirstOrderUrlShortener

No one needs another URL minifier, but this is the only one I know of that's Star Wars themed! Absolutely no one's using it, so be the first one! And while your at it, create a pull request and make it better...this may not be the URL shortener the Internet needs, but it's what the Internet deserves!
